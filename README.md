# Drone-Based Crack Detection and Instance Segmentation for Industry Inspection

This project aims to revolutionize industrial inspection through drone-based crack detection and instance segmentation. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies like YOLOv8, SAM (Segment Anything Model), and the Roboflow API, we propose a comprehensive solution for semantic segmentation and annotation enhancement.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Deploy drones equipped with high-resolution cameras to enable real-time monitoring of industrial infrastructure.
- **Accurate Detection**: Detect cracks and structural anomalies with unprecedented accuracy.
- **Efficient Object Detection**: Integration of YOLOv8 and SAM ensures efficient object detection.
- **Precise Segmentation**: Achieve precise segmentation of cracks for detailed analysis.
- **Annotation Enhancement**: The Roboflow API streamlines annotation processes, enhancing dataset quality.
- **Improving Safety and Efficiency**: This innovative approach promises to significantly improve safety, efficiency, and maintenance practices in various industrial sectors.
